# HTTP Server Timings library for Spring Boot projects

This library is based on the HTTP Server Timings spec, which you can find here: https://www.w3.org/TR/server-timing/. The main idea is to be able to determine if any slow downs, bottlenecks or unexpected application issues happened for a request just by looking at the Network Tab on the browser, without the need to look at console logs or installing any tools.

# Features
  - Generate response header with traces that will be rendered by the client browser to analyze response times
  - Use as annotation to trace a method, or inject the Tracing interface to trace a block of code

# Instructions
  - add the dependency from maven central:
```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.github.sercasti</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-httpserver-timings</artifactId>
            <version>0.0.6</version>
        </dependency>
```
  
  - add these Beans to your spring config:
```
    @Bean
    protected Tracing tracing() {
        return TracingConfig.createTracing();
    }

    @Bean
    protected TracingFilter tracingFilter() {
        return new TracingFilter();
    }
    
    @Bean
    protected TracingInterceptor tracingInterceptor() {
        return new TracingInterceptor(tracing());
    }
```
# Usage
  - Use the @Traceable annotation around a method to generate a metric with the name of the method.
  - or autowire/inject the Tracing interface and use it on a specific block of code

# Example
  - You can find a sample app using this library here: https://github.com/sercasti/spring-servertimings-example
